I wrote up some pretty rough code to run the Monty Hall Problem, which is as follows:
A gameshow host has shown you three doors. 1 has a car behind it, and 2 have goats.
Once you pick a door to oepn, the host then opens one of the doors that had a goat behind it.
You are then given the option to switch which door you would like to open.
While it feels like keeping vs swtitching should be a 50/50 scenario,
You will actually get the car 2/3rds of the time if you switch.
